#RapGenerator

A proof-of-concept for a rap music generation app.

##TODO:
1. Improve rhyme engine.
  * Improve rhyme index for multi-syllabic rhymes Proposed rule:
    * Starting from the end of the word keep leters until you hit a syllable break (identified by a number in the dictionary), then take letters going backwards until you hit a vowel.
