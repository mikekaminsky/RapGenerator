#RapGenerator

A proof-of-concept for a rap music generation app.

##TODO:
1. Improve randomization for grabbing rhymes
2. Figure out way of identifying and excluding 'bad' lyrics.
3. Improve rhyme engine.
  * Do some analysis on which rhymes are most and least prevalent. May want to exclude lines that don't have enough potential rhymes.
  * Exclude same-word rhymes
  * Improve rhyme index for multi-syllabic rhymes
